# Music-Representing-Language
A simple domain specific language for single track music representation implemented with java (final project of the course in the fundamentals of compilation). Learn more about the language design and implementation from **MusicRepresentingLanguage.pdf**

Several complied and generated results of mrl codes in `usecase` are provided already in `result`. You can listen to them first to learn about what kind of music can mrl generate.

## How to run

1. Make sure jdk has been installed, check it by running `java --version`
2. Git clone this repo
3. Run `build.bat` to compile the source code
4. Run `run.bat` to generate midi music with the txt files in `usecase`. Modify `run.bat` to use different mrl source code. 
5. Use any midi player to play the results!

To write your own mrl file, please refer to MusicRepresentingLanguage.pdf and write your mrl code with correct grammar.

## TODO

1. Improve the exception handling design
2. Give a clear and simple guide on how to write valid mrl source code in README
3. Come up with a new name for mrlðŸ˜«
